          WELCOME TO MACRO TRACKER
___________________________________________________
  A beginner CLI program made with Ruby and SQLite 
that interacts directly with a Food Database API
https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-docs

          What the Application Does
___________________________________________________
  Our CLI program allows a user to enter in the
meals they made for the day as well as recipes
used to make those meals. MACRO Tracker has
state of the art technology to add up your Macros
and display them across the screen in real time.
  Macro Tracker will break down your Calories,
Protein, Fats & Carbohydrates consumed per meal
and serving as well. Simply enter in the number of
servings as well as amount of grams your recipe calls
for, and sit back and allow Macro Tracker to do
all the calculations for you!
  To use the app simply sign up after installing the
application (Instructions Below). Don't have time
to enter in all your meals at once? Not a problem,
we added a feature to welcome you back at any time
to be able to go into the program and add more meals
or even delete a meal you didn't have time to eat.
It's that simple!
